            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Archisha Dubey, an IP student from Cedar Girls' Secondary School. I aspire to take H2 Computing in Victoria Junior College. I am very passionate about Computer Science and Computing, and I hope to take a subject that I look forward to learning! Ever since primary school, I have had a passion for coding. I went for robotics from P1 to P6 and even went for coding classes. As I aspire to take H2 computing at Victoria Junior College, I am drawn to the Computing department's emphasis on hands-on learning and group work that would allow me to find solutions as a team. I believe that VJC will provide me with the ideal environment to further enhance my skills and passion as well as contribute to the vibrant computing community.</p>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
            <p>During the June and November-December holidays, while managing my academics, I also invested time in learning new programming languages as I was intrigued as to how people wrote lines of code to create websites and animations. This also helped to kickstart my making of mini projects.</p>
            <p>These are some of the programme languages I have learnt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Python</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>Through this process of learning new languages on my own, I used some really helpful resources. This not only sped up my learning journey but also piqued my interest in the projects that people build and how they use the various languages.</p>

          <p><u>Harvard CS50</u></p>
          <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8mAITcNt710/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Additional Image" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
          <p>With the help of CS50, I was able to promptly learn the various languages and also learnt its applications. I was able to code simple things like a calculator that does simple calculations and even things like a phonebook. I even learnt class and objects which helped me understand the languages better to progress with bigger projects.</p>

     <h2>Some of my projects</h2>
     <p>As I began sharpening my skills and started applying the various things that I learnt, I began building various projects. From the most simple quintessential “Hello, World” to mini games, I began developing the love for coding and computing.</p>

    <h2>My experience</h2>
    <p>As I began gaining the skills and interest in coding and computing, I started going for some events which I found very fun. This made me enjoy working in teams and trying to build my collaboration skills. This is also why I am looking forward to taking computing in VJC as I have heard that it involves a lot of teamwork.</p>

          <p>As my interest in coding continued, I attended a cybersecurity workshop during my VCademy. I learnt about the various types of methods to encode and decode like Base64 and JSON. This further sparked my interest as I also tried to find a way out of the escape room that was curated for us.</p>

    <p>In 2019, I took part in MakeX, which was a robotics competition with my brother for fun.</p>
   <p>Additionally, I also tried out the sample online VJC computing lectures to gauge how the subject would be like and practiced the various tutorials. And I have also begun on some ML(machine learning) projects.</p>
